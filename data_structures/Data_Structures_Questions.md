Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depthFirstForEach` method?
==> O(n). Cb is called once for each item in tree

2. What is the space complexity of your `depthFirstForEach` function?
==> O(1). No additional space is necessary, purely recursive definition

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadthFirstForEach` method?
==> O(n). Every node is visited

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadthFirstForEach` method? 


5. What is the runtime complexity of your `heapsort` function?


6. What is the space complexity of the `heapsort` function? Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array?
==> O(2n). Building the heap takes n spots in memory, and the resulting output array also takes n spots.
